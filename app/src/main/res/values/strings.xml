    <string name="about_contents1">A demonstration application providing RPP information to the client.</string>
    <string name="about_contents2">
        Contents include brief information of blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR), followed by the significance of rate pressure product (RPP).
        Based on the values of RPP, the app provides personalized suggestions for optimal workout routine </string>
    <string name="about_contents3">The app is consisted of three parts: introduction, rpp measurement, and exercise suggestion</string>

    <!--Welcome: second BP and HR page-->
    <string name="welcome_second_header">Blood Pressure and HR</string>
    <string name="welcome_second_content1">Blood Pressure (BP) and Heart Rate (HR) are the two most commonly used vital signs...</string>
    <string name="welcome_second_content2">Blood Pressure are typically indicated as SBP / DBP. Systolic BP (SBP) being the max BP, and Diastolic BP (DBP) the minimum. Normal BP is around 120/90; above is considered hyperyensive and below is considered as hypotensive</string>
    <string name="welcome_second_content3">
        It is important to be aware of one\s BP; hypertension, often referred to as the \Silent Killer,\ is the most common cardiovascular disease in America.
        It can be easily induced by various daily activities, such as caffeine or alcohol intake, stress, and consumption of salty foods.
        However, keeping up with BP is not a easy thing to do for many people, especially for those living busy lives.
        Furthermore, the reliability of the measurement made through irregular visits to hospitals is often compromised by the White Coat Effect.
        Hence, constant and frequent monitoring with smartphones will change many people\s lives</string>

    <!--Welcome: third RPP page-->
    <string name="welcome_third_header">Rate Pressure Product</string>
    <string name="welcome_third_content1">
        The importance of BP measurement is limited without personalized treatment to keep BP in a desirable range.
        Not only for those suffering from hypertension, but also for normal people, exercising is one of the most effective ways to keep the BP in a health level and stay fit</string>
    <string name="welcome_third_content2">
        However, everyone has different cardio-capacity and it is often difficult to find the most optimal work-out routine.
        Such concerns can be relieved with the Rate Pressure Product that can be measured from one\s smartphones at anywhere at anytime.
         </string>
    <string name="welcome_third_content3">
        Rate Pressure Product (RPP) = SBP X HR. Previously, there were attempts of measuring physical stress level only based on HR.
        RPP, can provide more comprehensive info since BP and HR are combined
